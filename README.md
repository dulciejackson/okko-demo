# OKKO Demo

This project demos a basic social media-esque feed, built in React and TypeScript.

The app uses Tailwind for styling and React Query to handle interactions with the JSON Placeholder API.

## Dev Setup

1. Run `yarn install` in the top level folder to install dependencies.
1. Create a `.env.local` file based on the `.env.example` template provided. The API URL should be the URL of the JSON Placeholder API.
1. Run `yarn dev` to start running and adding to the project!
